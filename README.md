JavaScript War Game
The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards

THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time, and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player places three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher card takes both piles (ten cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places another three cards face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all 18 cards, and so on.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

REQUIREMENTS
You must have a constructor for Game, Player, Deck, and Card
You must attach methods to the prototype chain
You must create a basic UI that includes a draw button and message box that informs the game status after each draw (e.g. What cards were drawn? Which player won the hand? How many cards does each player have?)
